In this paper, we aim to provide a comparison of machine learning and more traditional econometric techniques to forecast US GDP. Machine learning (ML) algorithms have become increasingly popular specially over the last two decade, and their application has been wide ranging. This popularity has meant that it was about time before the ML algorithms were used to forecasting macro variables. Through this paper, we have used key ML algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, Dynamic Factor Model and Vector Support Machines, Elastic Net and Decision trees to forecast the US GDP. More importantly, we have also used the traditional time series methods such as ARIMA, OLS and VAR to draw comparison between the ML and these methods. Based on our findings, ML models perform better than the traditional time series methods such as VAR and ARIMA but perform worse than basic estimation method such as OLS and more complex econometric model such as Dynamic Factor Model. This study is only limited to forecasting of the US GDP and other results might be different specially for high frequency, widely available variables. Within the scope of this study, ML algorithms have shown only incremental impact for macroeconomic forecasting, much less so than in other areas.

This is part of the Special Project class at NYU, taught by Dr. Irasema Alonso.
