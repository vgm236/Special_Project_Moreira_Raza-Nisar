In this paper, we aim to provide a comparison of machine learning and time series techniques to forecast US GDP. Machine learning algorithms have become increasingly popular specially over the last decade, and their application has been wide ranging. This popularity has meant that it was about time before the ML algorithms were used to forecasting macro variables.Through this paper, we have used key ML algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, Dynamic Factor Model and Vector Support Machines, Elastic Net and Decision trees to forecast the US GDP. More importantly, we have also used the traditional time series methods such as ARIMA and VAR to draw comparison between the ML and time series methods. Based on our findings, the traditional time series methods and specially the OLS performs fairly decent compared to the complex ML algorithms on the basis of Root Mean Squared Errors and time to run. However, this study is only limited to forecasting of the US GDP. It is quite possible that the results might be different specially for high frequency macroeconomic variables. But, within the scope of this study, we believe that the ML algorithms donot provide any substantial gain over the traditional time series models to forecast US GDP.

This is part of the Special Project class at NYU, taught by Dr. Irasema Alonso.
